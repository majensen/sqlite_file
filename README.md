SQLite_File - Tie to SQLite, with DB_File emulation

SQLite_File can be used with AnyDBM_File to provide an SQLite option
for tying hashes and arrays. It is meant to be a nearly complete 
substitute for DB_File; for this you will also need AnyDBM_File::Importer.

Thanks for downloading!

To install, simply:
