SQLite\_File - Tie to SQLite, with DB\_File emulation

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/majensen/sqlite_file.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/majensen/sqlite_file)

SQLite\_File can be used with AnyDBM\_File to provide an SQLite option
for tying hashes and arrays. It is meant to be a nearly complete 
substitute for DB\_File; for this you will also need AnyDBM\_File::Importer.
